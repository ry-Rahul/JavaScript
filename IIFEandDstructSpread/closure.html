        //A closure is a feature of JavaScript that allows inner functions to access the outer scope of a function. Closure helps in binding a function to its outer boundary and is created automatically whenever a function is created. A block is also treated as a scope since ES6. 
        //return a function with its lexical environment

        //closure is a function with its lexical environment (scope chain) intact
